many ppl run from theory but learning adnd understanding theory is important
data storage:aisa kuch jaha par ham saare ki info store kar skte hai

data bases:where we store large about od data and of many types of data.
types:
SQl: keep data into a structure : table
NoSQL:here tables is not a structure, in this we have objects{
    name:"yukti",
    age:21,
}
you need just basic info about how objects works., nosql is conceptual
MongoDB is db name who follows NoSQL , MongoDB is implementation of Nosql concept.Its actual database based on Nosql,and stores data into objects from.

why MOngoDB:
in order to store data, any ppl data name,age,likes,followers etc to store various kind of data

In backend we have two servers:application server(routes , request etc ) and database server(all the data related work )

Termonologies:

IN CODE SIDE                                  IN MOngoDB
-----------------------------------------------------------------
DB setup                                      DB formation
Model                                         collections
schema                                        document

so in a amazon's database can be divided into various types of data like userdata , admin data,customer data ,  premium user data etc this variety in datasets in the same database is created using models (when you writing code for creating different type of data parts)(in mongodb collections)
and i this various 
code likhte h model ka jo ki database me collection banata h ex.userModel , user ka collection bana hai
and when you create schema in code so in database me documents banate h 


ik app ka pura data {a whole khandan} => database
app me different verity of different data hota h but pura data app ka hi hota h {small small family}  bante h model se =>collection
and small family me se ik particular person like me so it will be a document , collections me se ik user=>document

collections:sells collection,user collection : customer collections etc[different types of data in db].
document:users collections me se when you are seeing any particulary user's data this is called as document.


Database -> Collections ->Documents

---------------------------------------
when we connect mongoose.connect ->database create and connect
model created ->collection creation
user model , customer model etc
create -> document create hota hai
schema->ik user ke pass kya kya dikhega
---------------------------------------

implementation in code:
INSTALLATION:
go to mongodb website go products and click on community edition and get download button
MongoDB connection
{get two servers , Node server and a db server}
npm i express and npm i mongoose
mongoose help talk between node server and db server
